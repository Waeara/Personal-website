# Personal-website
This is a personal website, built as part of a self learning process of HTML and CSS.

You can access the website for [here](https://waeara.github.io/Personal-website/).

For the publications page, I wrote 2 web scrappers:
1) The ORCID one struggled with some SSL error (same happend with Scholar and Scopus APIs), So eventually I inserted the data manually. 
2) The Medium scraper worked great.

For the Contact Me I used "Formspree" solution.
