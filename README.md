# Personal-website
This personal website was built as part of a self-learning process of HTML and CSS.

You can access the website [here](https://waeara.github.io/Personal-website/).

For the publications page, I wrote two web scrappers:
1) The ORCID one struggled with some SSL errors (the same happened with Scholar and Scopus APIs), so I inserted the data manually into the HTML script. 
2) The Medium scraper worked great.

For the Contact Me, I used the "Formspree" solution.
