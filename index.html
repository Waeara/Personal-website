            <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Engineering at Tel Aviv University, At the <a href="https://www.mamanelab.sites.tau.ac.il/" target="_blank">Water-Energy Laboratory</a>, holding a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Earth Sciences, with an emphasis on Environmental Studies. During my last year of undergraduate studies, I joined the direct program for an M.Sc. in the Environmental Engineering Program at the Mechanical Engineering faculty, which I then continued in a direct program toward a Ph.D.</p>
            <p>My research, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hadas-mamane-80b53419a/" target="_blank">Prof. Hadas Mamane</a>, focuses mainly on water quality modeling and analysis, where I apply data science techniques to develop tools and models to simplify complicated, time-consuming, and expansive water tests. This includes microbial and chemical water tests for drinking and recreational waters. In addition, as part of the research, we develop and construct real-time, in-situ, and affordable water-contact sensors for field tests. These sensors support and are being used for various research in low-middle resource communities.</p>
            <p>I have a strong background in data science, machine learning, and deep neural networks, mainly on tabular data and multi-spectral imagery. My goal is to find, develop, and test innovative ways to understand better and quickly what is in the water, except for H2O.</p>
