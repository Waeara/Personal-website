      "Title: Python Automated WhatsApp Message Sender 2.0\n",
      "Subtitle: A week ago, I published a story about how to “build an automated WhatsApp sender that will send randomized messages on your behalf during the day”, and after a few days, it gained more than 20,000 views. Many people on multiple platforms (Medium, LinkedIn, and more) ask me many questions about how we can make it easier to use. So the first step to making it more applicable is to transfer the user interface into a GUI that will be more intuitive.\n",

      "Title: Use Raster’s Data as ML and AI Inputs\n",
      "Subtitle: My research focuses on developing machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms for water quality monitoring. In this field, real-world data is complex and rare to find, and whenever I get data, it doesn’t contain too many features. That’s why I must add many meta-data features that may affect the target I want to predict. A few months ago, I found out that there is a lot of data which is stored in pictures called ‘rasters’. So in this article, I will show how to take this raster and extract its data so it can be used as inputs for ML and AI models.\n",

      "Title: Python Automated WhatsApp Message Sender\n",
      "Subtitle: Last week was very busy at work, and I barely managed during the day to arrange a time for lunch and worse than that — to talk to my wife and ask how she is. After a week where in the evenings, I had to explain why I didn't have a few seconds to send a WhatsApp message, I came up with the idea — to build a Python script that would send a daily message on my behalf. So I set out on a mission to create one and try to make it as general, random, and reliable as possible. The last thing I need is for her to find out that I spent time building such a script instead of just sending a message…\n",

      "Subtitle: For one of the projects in my research, there was a need to produce an interactive map, and as a Python programmer, I knew several methods to perform the task. To carry out the job, I chose to use the Folium library, but the popup markers that can be designed are fundamental, so to improve the design of the popups, I integrated HTML into the code. In this article, I will present a simple but beautiful example.\n",
